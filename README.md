# Who's a Howler
A simple guess who game based in the Universe of the [Red Rising](https://www.piercebrown.com/redrisingsaga) book series by [Pierce Brown](https://www.piercebrown.com/aboutpierce).

## Rules
The point of the game is to identify the Howlers amongst the group before all non-Howlers have been eliminated. The game is played in a series of rounds. During each round each role will get a chance to perform their specific actions.

### Roles
At the beginning of the game all players are given a role card. Each role will have a specific ability or function within each round of the game.

#### Howler
Darrow's Elite and most loyal supporters, the Howlers have one goal in the current setting eliminate any color not loyal to the Rising. During their turn the Howlers pick their target. All Howlers must agree on a target, if not that round is a wash.

#### Carver
Carvers create or modify organic lifeforms. During their turn the Carver can pick two other players and swap their roles. These roles stay with their new owners until the end of the game or until roles are changed by either a Carver or similar.

#### Legionnaire
Soldiers of the Society. During their turn the Legionnaires can pick another player to defend. If their ward is targeted by the Howlers in the same round the ward is spared. The legionnaires may not shield the same player in consecutive rounds.

#### Primus 
The head of Gold Houses. The Primus and Stained take their turns at the same time with each Primus claiming a Stained. If the Primus is targeted by the Howlers then their Stained is killed instead and one of the Howlers dies as well. If there are more Stained than there are Primus then the unselected Stained goes berserk.

#### Stained
The monstrous brutes of the Obsidian. During their turn the Stained are selected by a Primus. If an Stained's Primus is targeted by Howlers then the Stained is killed instead and a Howler dies as well. If the Stained is not selected by a Primus they go berserk and will attack a selected target. If the target is a Howler the Stained is killed. If the target is not a Howler the target is killed.

#### Rose
Trained in reading human body language. During their turn a Rose may view another player's role. 

#### Doctor
Trained in medicines and natural sciences. During their turn a Doctor may chose to save a player. This save can happen only once per game per Doctor.
